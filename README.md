# How to Learn Computer Vision
This is a collection of materials I used to start learning computer vision, and how I would learn it better. 

Before going through the resources, I'd like to note that youâ€™ll find that computer vision and artificial intelligence has a lot of painful, fun math behind it. If you like math, you can go deeper into them, but the libraries abstract this math into easy-to-use functions. If you're focused on the application aspect of computer vision as I was, it will suffice and save you time to have an overview of what tools you have at your disposal. If you use the tool or see the tool being used in your project, then I'd go deeper into understanding how it works.

## Traditional Image Processing
Before I started learning software for computer vision, I started with learning the theory. I particularly enjoyed Shree Nayar's course "First Principles of Computer Vision".
After tak:
- **traditional image processing with [OpenCV](https://github.com/SeanKenRuiz/how-to-learn-computer-vision/blob/main/README.md#OpenCV)**,
- then **neural networks with [PyTorch](https://github.com/SeanKenRuiz/how-to-learn-computer-vision/blob/main/README.md#pytorch)**,
- and finally **[YOLOv8](https://github.com/SeanKenRuiz/how-to-learn-computer-vision/blob/main/README.md#YOLOv8) (You Only Look Once version 8) computer vision model and framework**.
