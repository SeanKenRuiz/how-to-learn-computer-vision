# How to Learn Computer Vision
This is a collection of materials I used to start learning computer vision, and how I would learn it better. 

The general path I took started off with learning:
- **traditional image processing with OpenCV**,
- then **neural networks with PyTorch**,
- and finally to using the **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) computer vision model and framework**.
