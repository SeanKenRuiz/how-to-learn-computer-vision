# How to Learn Computer Vision
This is a collection of materials I used to start learning and using computer vision for my internship.

Before going through the resources, I'd like to note that youâ€™ll find that computer vision and artificial intelligence has a lot of painful, fun math behind it. Fortunately, the libraries abstract this math into easy-to-use functions. If you're focused on the application aspect of computer vision as I was, it could save you time to just have an overview of what tools you have at your disposal instead of worrying about learning about the math of each and every function you use (as I was). 

A simplified version of the path I used to learn computer vision started off with learning:
- **traditional image processing with [OpenCV](https://github.com/SeanKenRuiz/how-to-learn-computer-vision/blob/main/README.md#OpenCV)**,
- then **neural networks with [PyTorch](https://github.com/SeanKenRuiz/how-to-learn-computer-vision/blob/main/README.md#pytorch)**,
- and finally **[YOLOv8](https://github.com/SeanKenRuiz/how-to-learn-computer-vision/blob/main/README.md#YOLOv8) (You Only Look Once version 8) computer vision model and framework**.

### OpenCV
OpenCV gives you a good amount of tools for traditional image processing. 

Just a warning that once you get to neural networks, a bulk of traditional image processing techniques will not need to be used again, however it is very good to understand them as a foundation. Additionally, the only part from the OpenCV library I used in the internship project was to capture and display the video feed from my camera. 

For learning, I straight up used the [OpenCV-Python Tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) however this [tutorial video series by Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlYPhdTbRmk&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lUA8uGjeXhBUUzPYc6vZRn&index=2&ab_channel=TechWithTim) orders the content way better and lets you know about errors you will potentially run into.

Additionally, don't pidgeonhole yourself with using just these materials. Learning using these materials is what helped me and you can find a bunch of other resources on Google, Reddit, Github (like the [awesome computer vision repo](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision?tab=readme-ov)), etc. I'll list other resources that I didn't use, but would have been helpful through this page.
## Traditional Image Processing
Before I started learning OpenCV, I went through Shree Nayar's course "First Principles of Computer Vision" as it provides an in-depth look into computer vision. During the first couple weeks of my internship, and got fatigued (the Coursera course has a
