# How to Learn Computer Vision
This is a collection of materials I used to start learning computer vision, and how I would learn it better. 

The general path I took started off with learning:
- **traditional image processing with [OpenCV]([url](https://github.com/SeanKenRuiz/how-to-learn-computer-vision/blob/main/README.md#OpenCV))**,
- then **neural networks with [PyTorch]([url](https://github.com/SeanKenRuiz/how-to-learn-computer-vision/blob/main/README.md#pytorch))**,
- and finally **[YOLOv8]([url](https://github.com/SeanKenRuiz/how-to-learn-computer-vision/blob/main/README.md#YOLOv8)) (You Only Look Once version 8) computer vision model and framework**.
